<h2>A disruptive engine that handles and loops through various incoming nodes (targets) to modify their respective values (Machine learning). The base model is written in Java and can be used as a base for android specific libraries and applications. This is not an open source project for now and still under development. 'DE' is based upon unsupervised learning algorithm and the bagging & boosting algorithm. DE also incorporates the basic binomial sigmoidal function algorithm. You can use DE for training your 'nodes' from a map of inputs. Currently DE is exclusively used in Sapphire SDK for Android.</h2>
